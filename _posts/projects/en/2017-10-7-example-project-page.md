#### **A simple goal and habit tracker that works**.

This is my first completed android project release on google play. The app focus on the core concept of habit tracking, but with added concept of
choosing between the pain of regret or the pain of discipline.

<!--break-->
#### **So why name Repeat**
In order to form a new <span style="color:#e4a048;">habit</span>, one must do it a lot of times (<span style="color:#e4a048;">*70 days*</span>) hence the name <span style="color:#e4a048;">**Repeat**</span>.

The app focus on <span style="color:#e4a048;">**simplicity**</span>. <span style="color:#e4a048;">**No**</span> <span style="color:#e4a048;">*confusing*</span> UI or graphs (*graphs stresses me out*) instead the app motivates you not by actually looking at the graphs or calendar but by reminding you the feelings or emotion you will get if you accomplished your goal or failed to do it. Think of it this way, we all do something for a reason, it's either that will make us <span style="color:#e4a048;">**happy**</span> or that will make us <span style="color:#e4a048;">**misserable**</span>.

#### **Why we do what we do**
Do you go to a job that you really really hate? If yes, why do yo go there in the first place? You know why? It's because it is more painful if we don't have a job and don't have any food on our plate and that is even worse if we have a family to support. This is the <span style="color:#e4a048;">core concept</span> of the app, when you're feeling lazy the app reminds you of the consequence if you didn't do it, at the same time it will also remind you of the positive things that will happen if you do the newly formed habit.

#### **You don't have to read notification anymore**
I decided to add a google voice that will read my task for me for those people who don't read their notification. Pretty neat.

#### **Free and will remain to be so**
The app is completely free and no ads whatsoever. The app will be updated a lot. I will soon add features that I think will make the experience for users better.
